title: Extreme Cold - Part 1
---

When I first heard about the trek opportunity to Mongolia, I was intrigued at the thought of working and living abroad in a country I knew very little about. So I started researching. I found the answer to basic questions such as

  - Where is Mongolia? Answer: it's north of China and borders with Russia and China, and is land-locked

  - What is the capital of Mongolia? Answer: Ulaanbaatar

  - What is the population of Mongolia? Answer: About 3 million people. According to worldatlas.com, Greenland is the most sparsely populated country with 0.03 people per square kilometre and Mongolia is a close number four with 1.9 people.

My next natural question was ‘What will the weather in Mongolia be like while I would be there?’ (January to March). Answer: Mongolia is a country of extreme weather. It is hot in the summer months (July and August) and the complete opposite weather in winter (November to April). Ulaanbaatar, the capital, is known for being the coldest capital city in the world with temperatures in the -30s and -40s.

Did I forget to mention that January to March in Mongolia are the the coldest months of the year? Knowing the weather would be less than ideal, I was hesitant about whether to go on the trek. It's true that I had been seeking a work experience abroad, but I wondered to myself if I really wanted to work in a country that is colder than Canada.

A few days after mulling over things and considering what was right for me, I had a one-on-one with a colleague. When I told her about the possible trek, her eyes lit up. She was genuinely excited about the assignment and strongly encouraged me to accept it. Her only caveat was making sure it was okay with my husband, Andrew. She expressed her regret at not having gone on a short-term  secondment abroad when she was a junior, so she didn't want me to miss out on this unforgettable, once in a lifetime experience. I voiced my concern about the weather. She dismissed it and reassuringly said that I would be able to handle it, without giving it a second thought. She had lived in Canadian cities with similar sub-zero temperatures and she had managed fine. Her advice was to dress warmly and invest in the appropriate winter clothing. From that day forward, I knew the weather wouldn't be a factor in my decision.

My parents and my husband were concerned about the weather, but at the same time, they wanted me to be happy and to make the decision for myself and no one else. Feeling supported by my family, friends, and firm and ready to change things up, I said yes to the trek.

Once the wheels were in motion, the next most important thing was getting clothing that could withstand and help me endure Mongolia’s winter. I was too busy drowning in work to envision what it would be like, other than trying to remember the frigid, cold days when I lived in Ottawa during law school.

Hat, mittens, scarf, long johns, thermal socks, and heavy duty winter coat and boots—my To Buy list. Don't get me wrong, I have winter clothing. I just thought warmer things were necessary. The shopping trip to cross off items on my list went well, and Andrew tagged along. He gave me his two-cents, including “buy these black diamond mittens that can go over your coat sleeves and tighten around your wrist. It will keep the cold out.”

I remember thinking the mittens were over-the-top and bulky, but with time running out and no better option they came home with me that day. Also, at the very last minute, I ordered online a pair of -50 grade winter boots. It was the first time I had online-ordered shoes or boots of any kind, which required just the right size. Thankfully, the boots arrived at my office the day before I was booked to fly out and they fit like a glove.

In the end, I didn’t buy a new winter coat, new hat, or new scarf. I took my old stuff that I wear at the worst part of Toronto winters, figuring I would either use them in Mongolia or buy warmer things. Many people have commented online that there is no point stocking up on winter stuff at home. Instead, these seasoned travellers advise to buy what you need in Mongolia itself. It makes complete sense. When you are from a country that does not have cold winters, it won’t have winter wear. Mongolians will have clothing that works for their climate. In my case, coming from a country with sub-zero temperatures half of the year, I mixed it up a bit.

With a few long johns, a couple pairs of thermal socks, -50 grade boots, and my usual winter wear packed up, I felt ready to face the extreme cold waiting for me in UB.
