title: Welcome to Mongolia
---

It's been almost a month since I've been living in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and it feels like I arrived here yesterday. That feeling of flying time is due in large part to my new colleagues and friends making me feel so welcome.

After the first day I arrived, one of my new colleagues, Nara, came to meet me at my new place and take me out. I had my sights set on going to a grocery store to stock up on essentials (bread, veggies, milk, breakfast food, PB&J, etc), with Nara's help and guidance. I realized very quickly there was no trace of food in the appartment, a basic need for living and for emergency hunger pangs, and there was no toilet paper either, also a staple of life need I say more.

Nara, as smart as she is, knew the key to my heart, and first took me to an irish pub for brunch.
I learned about her and her family. She is Mongolian-born and raised, she went to uni in Mongolia, completed a Masters in London, and was initially planning to stay in London permanently until a family emergency brought her back to Ulaanbaatar, where in fact she met her to-be husband, and now is part of a family of four. She has two young boys, one of which is less than a year old! Yes here she was taking me out to brunch on a chilly day in January.

After we filled up on food, Nara and I walked over to the nearby supermarket. My first outing in the city. It was cold, but bearable. When we crossed any road, Nara linked her arm with mine and we walked together like sisters. I felt hospitality, immediate friendship, and belonging. That was my first day in Ulaanbaatar.

The next day, Nara came again. But this time she had the company car and a bigger plan for us. She took me to the city's Buddhist monestary (Gandantegchinlen) and then to a ger resort in the countryside, where we had lunch at a traditional Mongolian restaurant (inside a ger). as an FYI, a ger is a more sturdier version of a tent that is used as a place to live by nomads. Much of Mongolia's population live in a ger (according to google, over 50% of the population is nomadic and lives in gers).

I enjoyed getting to know Nara and learning about the city and the countryside. It was hard for me to believe that she could take so much time away from her family on a weekend (it was a Sunday that we toured around). I am grateful for her willingness to spend the time and make me feel at home. It was a perfect way to start this secondment. Everyday since I have made fast friends at work and feel I have been embraced with warmth and belonging.

In my first week at the Mongolian firm, another one of my new colleagues, Sanaa, organized a lunch at a Mongolian hot pot restaurant (The Bull) for the entire tax group to welcome me to the team. The restaurant was modern and tastefully decorated. We had a private room for the 10-11 of us and sat around a large circular table (circle tables are amazing for feeling connected to everyone). The more senior ladies ordered for the table, and Sanaa perused the menu with me to ask if there was anything else I wanted as well.

I appreciate every person's hospitality and interest in my happiness and well-being. It pushes away any feelings of being homesick and has immensely helped smooth my transition into this new environment and place to live. And these are only a few of the stories of Nara's and Sanaa's kindness, not all. Also, let's not forget the rest of my colleagues who have shown kindness, Lkhamaa, Maikaa, Nymaa, Nomin, Doljo, and my new supervisor, Nicole.
